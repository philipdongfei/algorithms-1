/**
 * 1.3.45 Stack generability.
 * Suppose that we have a sequence of intermixed push and pop operations as with our test stack client,
 * where the integers 0, 1, ..., N-1 in that order (push directives) are intermixed with N minus signs (pop directives).
 * Devise an algorithm that determines whether the intermixed sequence causes the stack to underflow.
 * (You may use only an amount of space independent of N—you cannot store the integers in a data structure.)
 * Devise a linear-time algorithm that determines whether a given permutation can be generated as output
 * by our test client (depending on where the pop directives occur).
 *
 * Solution: The stack does not overflow unless there exists an integer k such that the first k pop operations
 * occur before the first k push operations. If a given permutation can be generated,
 * it is uniquely generated as follows: if the next integer in the output permutation is in the top of the stack,
 * pop it; otherwise, push it onto the stack.
