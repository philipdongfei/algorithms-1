/**
 * 1.3.40 Move-to-front.
 * Read in a sequence of characters from standard input and maintain the characters in a linked list with no duplicates.
 * When you read in a previously unseen character, insert it at the front of the list.
 * When you read in a duplicate character, delete it from the list and reinsert it at the beginning.
 * Name your program MoveToFront: it implements the well-known move-to-front strategy, which is useful for caching,
 * data compression, and many other applications where items that have been recently accessed
 * are more likely to be reaccessed.
