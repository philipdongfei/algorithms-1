/**
 * 1.3.39 Ring buffer.
 * A ring buffer, or circular queue, is a FIFO data structure of a fixed size N.
 * It is useful for transferring data between asynchronous processes or for storing log files.
 * When the buffer is empty, the consumer waits until data is deposited; when the buffer is full,
 * the producer waits to deposit data. Develop an API for a RingBuffer and
 * an implementation that uses an array representation (with circular wrap-around).
