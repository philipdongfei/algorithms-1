/**
 * 1.3.38 Delete kth element.
 * Implement a class that supports the following API:
 *
 *  public class GeneralizedQueue<Item>
 *      GeneralizedQueue() create an empty queue
 *      boolean isEmpty() is the queue empty?
 *      void insert(Item x) add an item
 *      Item delete(int k) delete and return the kth least recently inserted item
 * API for a generic generalized queue
 *
 * First, develop an implementation that uses an array implementation,
 * and then develop one that uses a linked-list implementation.
 * Note: the algorithms and data structures that we introduce in Chapter 3 make it possible
 * to develop an implementation that can guarantee that both insert() and delete() take time prortional
 * to the logarithm of the number of items in the queueâ€”see Exercise 3.5.27.
