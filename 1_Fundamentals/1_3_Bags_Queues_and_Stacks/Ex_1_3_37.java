/**
 * 1.3.37 Josephus problem.
 * In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire straits
 * and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population.
 * They arrange themselves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle,
 * eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out
 * where to sit to avoid being eliminated.
 * Write a Queue client Josephus that takes N and M from the command line and prints out the order
 * in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
