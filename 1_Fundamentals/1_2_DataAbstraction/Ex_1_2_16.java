/**
 * 1.2.16 Rational numbers.
 * Implement an immutable data type Rational for rational numbers that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication,
 * and division.
 *
 *  public class Rational
 *      Rational(int numerator. int denominator)
 *      Rational plus(Rational b) sum of this number and b
 *      Rational minus(Rational b) difference of this number and b
 *      Rational times(Rational b) product of this number and b
 *      Rational divides(Rational b) quotient of this number and b
 *      boolean equals(Rational that) is this number equal to that ?
 *      String toString() string representation
 *
 * You do not have to worry about testing for overflow (see Exercise 1.2.17),
 * but use as instance variables two long values that represent the numerator
 * and denominator to limit the possibility of overflow.
 * Use Euclidâ€™s algorithm (see page 4) to ensure that the numerator and denominator never have any common factors.
 * Include a test client that exercises all of your methods.
