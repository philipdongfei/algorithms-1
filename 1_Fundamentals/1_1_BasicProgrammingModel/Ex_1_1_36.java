/**
 * 1.1.36 Empirical shuffle check.
 * Run computational experiments to check that our shuffling code on page 32 works as advertised.
 * Write a program ShuffleTest that takes command-line arguments M and N,
 * does N shuffles of an array of size M that is initialized with a[i] = i before each shuffle,
 * and prints an M-by-M table such that row i gives the number of times i wound up in position j for all j.
 * All entries in the array should be close to N/M.
